This is readme , a first hand document, for Gen SDK describes version information and documentation place holder.

The current Gen SDK  currently has following sub-directories and files.

->Makefile - Master makefile. before using this set relevant build time environment variables in Makefile.globals

->Makefile.globals - container for all build options. user can make changes here to mention current system configuration.
				   - Make sure to set KSRC as per where to find kernel headers or compiled kernel source
				   - If cross-compiling the SDK set the CROSS_COMPILE accordingly to where to fing the compiler to use
				   - Set ARCH as per the architecture of the Microcontroller
                    (See ZLS38100 SDK user's guide for more info)				   

->config.mk - defines all build options to compile-time variables

->docs - contains documentation on Generic SDK. Refer to ZLS38100_SDK_USer_Guide

->platform directory - contains platform specific drivers, and in particular case documentation for the platform

5. driver
	Contains an Generic HBI driver for all microsemi vproc family of devices. Behavior of the driver controlled by setting releavant options in makefile.globals.
	Refer to ZLS38100_SDK_USer_Guide for overview of design and approach

6. lnxdriver
	Contains HBI user and kernel space driver for linux platform. refer to ZLS38100_SDK_USer_Guide for overview of its features and usage

7. tools 
	Placeholder to keep tools to convert firmware .s3 image to *.bin or *.h .c-style output AND configuration record .cr2 image to either *.bin or *.h c-style output

8. apps
	placeholder for various sample test apps.

9. thirdparty
 	software packages, applications, plugins which acts as typical 3rd-party apps to test Microsemi Device capabilities
